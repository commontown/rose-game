# Rose Game

## Installations
1. Create .npmrc file
2. Add the following codes into the newly created .npmrc file.
```
@commontown:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=<your_personal_access_token>
```
3. Replace `<your_personal_access_token>` with your token. 
4. Run `npm install`. If it's not working, you maybe lacking the access to [arcade-library](https://github.com/commontown/arcade-library) and need to request for access accordingly.
5. Installations are done at this point. You may run `npm start` to begin playing the game.
